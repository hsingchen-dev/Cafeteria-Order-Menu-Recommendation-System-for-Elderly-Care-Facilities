# Cafeteria-Order-Menu-Recommendation-System-for-Elderly-Care-Facilities
A smart ordering assistant designed for care home cafeterias, allowing elderly users to order meals by voice while respecting dietary needs and personal preferences.


# Introduction
In aging societies like Japan, meal services in elderly care facilities face a critical dilemma known as the "Triple Constraint Problem" â€” balancing **food safety**, **menu diversity**, and **operational cost** is extremely difficult. 

- Prioritizing safety and cost leads to uniform meals, ignoring individual health conditions or preferences.
- Emphasizing safety and diversity increases labor costs and complexity.
- Focusing on cost and diversity risks mismatched meals that may harm patients' health.

To address this issue, we present an **AI-powered voice-based menu recommendation system** designed specifically for elderly care cafeterias. This system allows seniors to order meals simply by speaking, while the AI understands their preferences, dietary restrictions, and even emotional tone to recommend appropriate dishes. It ensures safety and personalization without increasing staff workload.

Key features include:
- LLM-based natural conversation and emotion-aware responses
- Health-aware filtering (diabetes, allergies, religious needs)
- Multilingual support (Japanese, English, Chinese)
- Tablet/smartphone compatibility for easy deployment
- Continuous learning from meal history and preferences

This system is designed not only to assist the elderly in making better meal choices, but also to reduce the burden on caregivers, enabling sustainable and inclusive food service in aged care environments.
